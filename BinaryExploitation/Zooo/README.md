## Zooo

In this challenge you are given an ELF executable file and an IP address and a port which runs this file on a server. 
```
nc 37.152.181.193 1337
```
Make the file executable using `chmod +x Zooo` and run it. After giving an input, you will see a `file not found` error which means that anything you give to this file as input, will be concatenated to `./` string in order to be executed (You can use a disassembler like IDA Pro to see what really happens).  
Now connect to server and give string below as input. You will see all files in server's current directory. There is a `Flag.txt` file. 
```
Apes & ls
```
Cause you know flag format, you can grep part of it and get the flag:
```
Apes & grep -r Razi
```
Here is your flag:
```
RaziCTF{st4y_s4f3_dur!n9_th!s_p4nd3m!c}
```
