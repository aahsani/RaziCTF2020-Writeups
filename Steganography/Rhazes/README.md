## Rhazes

### Challenge Description
Find the hidden chemical formula in this depiction of an alchemist known as Rhazes.

### Writeup
In this challeng you have an image. After trying multiple tools used for steganography, finaly `steghide` can extract an image from original image (We used `Rhazes` as key in `steghide`). The name of this image is `MagicSanitizer`. So we used MagicEye Solver, an online tool, to see the original image.
