## Recurzip

In this challenge you are given a zip file. It is extracted without any password. Inside this zip file, there is another zip file which needs a password to be extracted. If you notice to name of the file, you see it is a `base64` string. Decode this string and use it as password. You will see it is correct password. 
Inside this zip file, there is another zip file again with `base64` decoded string. Use it as password, it works. 
We wrote a python script in order to unzip the file recursively. 
Finaly `flag.txt` file will be extracted and here is the flag:
```
